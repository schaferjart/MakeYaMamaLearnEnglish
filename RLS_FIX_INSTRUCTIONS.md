# ðŸ”§ Fix RLS Policy Issue

## Current Problem
The database migration was successful, but now we're getting RLS (Row Level Security) policy violations when trying to create language pairs.

## Solution
Run the RLS policy fix in your Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor.

### Step 1: Access Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/koapryvdrgflimeheezh
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**

### Step 2: Run the RLS Fix
Copy and paste the contents of `COMPREHENSIVE_RLS_FIX.sql` into the SQL Editor and run it.

### Step 3: Test the Fix
After running the RLS fix:
1. Refresh your application
2. Try adding a language pair (e.g., Italian â†’ English)
3. Check the browser console for the debug log showing user ID
4. The language pair should be created successfully

## What the RLS Fix Does
- Drops any existing problematic policies
- Creates specific policies for SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations
- Ensures users can only access their own language pairs
- Uses `auth.uid() = user_id` to properly match authenticated users

## Debug Information
The application now logs the user ID when creating language pairs, so you can verify:
- User is properly authenticated
- User ID is being passed correctly
- RLS policy is working as expected

## Expected Result
After the RLS fix:
- âœ… No more "row-level security policy" errors
- âœ… Language pairs can be created successfully
- âœ… Users can only see their own language pairs
- âœ… Multi-language features work properly

The multi-language implementation is ready - just need this final RLS policy fix! ðŸš€
